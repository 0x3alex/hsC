# hsC

Some convenient functions, that i used in Haskell and wanted to have in C.

I created this for my own usage, so exuse the lack of comments and the "not clean" code.

Includes

```map``` for Int and Char Arrays

```filter``` for Int and Char Arrays

```take/drop``` for Int and Char Arrays

```find``` for Int Char Arrays

```maybe```-ish functionallity

There are no gernic functions to provide saftey while working whith those functions
